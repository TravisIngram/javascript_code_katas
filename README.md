## JavaScript Exercises

Exercises to practice programming in JavaScript.

These exercises were initially written in Ruby and part of the [CodeUnion][codeunion] curriculum.  They believe that one of the best ways to develop skills as a programmer is to write code and get feedback on your code in the form of a [code review][code-review] from a more experienced programmer.

They wrote these exercises with the intent to give you the opportunity to solve some fun programming challenges.

If you are a CodeUnion student, you can then submit your code and receive feedback on them using the [CodeUnion command-line tool][codeunion-cli-tool]. Preview an [example code review][example-code-review].

All of the core exercises can be found in the [exercises](exercises) directory, and bonus exercises (i.e. really tough ones) can be found in the [bonus](bonus) directory.

The exercise files are listed in alphabetical order.  It is __strongly recommended__ that they be completed in the [suggested order](exercises/_SUGGESTED_ORDER.md).

## Getting Started

1. [Fork][gh-help-forking] and clone this repository
1. Write code to solve individual exercises
1. Make small, frequent commits
1. Push your commits to your fork on GitHub

Once your code is on the GitHub, you can (and should) request feedback from your peers.

### Requirements

In order to run or execute these exercise files, you'll need to have a build environment set up in your text editor of choice.  In Atom, you have to install a particular package, [script](https://atom.io/packages/script).

For Sublime Text, it's a little more involved.  You will have to have Node installed and running (to interrupt the JS) for the build to work.  Here are two sets of instructions for getting this set up.

[WikiHow - Sublime Text JS Build](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Javascript-Console-in-Sublime-Text)

You can also run the exercises by simply copy and pasting them into sites like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) and [REPL.it](https://repl.it).
