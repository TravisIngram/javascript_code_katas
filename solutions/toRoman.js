/*
  Function name:  toRoman(num)
  Inputs:         A number.
  Returns:        A String representing the number in roman numerals.
  Prints:         Nothing

  toRoman(num); takes a number as input and returns that number using Roman numerals.

  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals

  It can be tricky to handle the cases where "IV" means 4.  As a first pass,
  don't hesitate to implement a simpler version where 4 is denoted by "IIII".

  Remember: the priority is FEEDBACK, even if your implementation can't handle
  every single case.

/*
  Write some of your own "sanity checks" here.  Each check should look like:

    console.log(toRoman(); == ...expected return value...);

  A good sanity check is like a canary in a coal mine: when it fails we know
  something is very wrong in our code.  This means sanity checks should
  reflect;

    1. The common cases
    2. The edge cases
    3. Likely mistakes you'll make in your code (e.g., using <= instead of <)

  What these cases mean concretely depends on what your function does.

  For example,

  roRoman(1);     == "I"
  roRoman(12);    == "XII"
  roRoman(123);   == "CXXIII"
  roRoman(1234);  == "MCCXXXIV"
  roRoman(12345); == "twelve thousand three hundred forty five"
