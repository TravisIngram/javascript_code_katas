/*
  Function name:  countInList(list, itemToCount);
  Inputs:         1. a list of anything, 2. an item for us to count in the list
  Returns:        The number of times our item is contained in the input list.
  Prints:         Nothing

  For example,
    countInList([1,2,3], 1);    == 1
    countInList([1,2,3], -1);   == 0
    countInList([1,1,1], 1);    == 3

  --- NOTE ---
  Some languages, like Ruby and Python, have built in methods to do this.
  JavaScript does not, so we have to write it ourselves.

  See: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html#method-i-count

function countInList(list, itemToCount) {
  // You'll need three things:
  //   1. A running total of the number of times you've seen the item.
  //   2. A way to loop/iterate through the list.
  //   3. A way to add to the running total as you see the item.

/*
  I'd advise putting some sanity checks here.
  How else will you confirm that your code does what you think it does?
