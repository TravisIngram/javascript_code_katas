/*
  Function name:  mean(list);
  Input:          A list of numbers.
  Returns:        The MEAN (aka average) of all the numbers in the list.
  Prints:         Nothing

  See: https://www.freemathhelp.com/arithmetic-mean.html

  For example,
    The mean of 5 and 2 is 2.5 since (5 + 2)/2 is 3.5
    The mean of 5 and 5 is 5.0 since (5 + 5)/2 is 5.0
    The mean of 10, 20, and 30 is 20.0 since (10 + 20 + 30)/3 is 20.0
    etc.

  Things we'll need:
    1. A way to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
    2. A way to calculate the length of the list.

  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length

  It's possible to use a function that was defined in another file,
  but that's not something we'll touch on here.  Instead, simply use the
  function that you built in the sum.js exercise.

function sum(list) {
  // This is your job. =]

}

function mean(list) {
  var total = sum(list);  // This is the "sum();" function from our sum.js file.
  // result = ____        // Given the list's sum, how can we calculate the average?
}

/*
  I'd advise putting some sanity checks here.
  How else will you confirm that your code does what you think it does?
