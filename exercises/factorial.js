/*
  Function name:  factorial(n);
  Inputs:         A single non-negative integer, n.
  Returns:        The factorial of n (see below).
  Prints:         Nothing

  The factorial of 5 is denoted by 5! and is defined as
    5! = 5*4*3*2*1

  In English, you'd read "5!" as "five factorial".  In general, the factorial
  of a number is the product of every number from that number down to 1, so

    4! = 4*3*2*1
   10! = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1

/*
  Write some of your own "sanity checks" here.  Each check should look like:

   console.log(factorial(__) == ...expected return value...);

  A good sanity check is like a canary in a coal mine: when it fails we know
  something is very wrong in our code.  This means sanity checks should
  reflect;

    1. The common cases
    2. The edge cases
    3. Likely mistakes you'll make in your code (e.g., using <= instead of <)

  What these cases mean concretely depends on what your function does.

  Remember: these are rumble strips, not a driving instructor.
  If any are "false" then something is broken. But just because they all return
  "true" doesn't mean you've nailed it. =]
