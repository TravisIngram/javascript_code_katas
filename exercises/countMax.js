/*
  Function name:  countMax(list);
  Inputs:         A list of numbers
  Returns:        The number of times the largest number in the list appears.
  Prints:         Nothing

  For example,
    countMax([10, 1, 2, 10, 10]);
    => 3

  The number "3" is returned since "10" is the largest number in the list and
  it occurs 3 times.

  ** Note **
  While it's possible to make use of a function that is contained in another
  file, that's a topic we'll cover later.

function countMax(list) {

  // You can write this using nothing more than the 'max();' and
  // 'countInList();' functions that you've already written.

  // Remember: inelegant, working code is better than elegant,
  // unfinished code.
}

/*
  I'd advise putting some sanity checks here.
  How else will you confirm that your code does what you think it does?
