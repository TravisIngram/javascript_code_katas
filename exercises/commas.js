/*
  Function name:  commas(num);
  Inputs:         A number, n.
  Returns:        A string representing the input, with commas inserted into the
                  correct position.
  Prints:         Nothing

  For example,

   commas(123);     == "123"
   commas(1234);    == "1,234"
   commas(12345);   == "12,345"
   commas(1234567); == "1,234,567"

  ** Note #1 **
  If it's too much, don't worry about handling negative numbers at first.

  ** Note #2 **
  As always, focus first on how you would do this *as a human*. Imagine you
  has a piece of paper with a comma-less number on it.  How would you decide to
  insert the commas?  Which comma would you insert first?

/*
  Write some of your own "sanity checks" here.  Each check should look like:

   console.log(mode([...data points...]) == ...expected return value...);

  A good sanity check is like a canary in a coal mine: when it fails we know
  something is very wrong in our code.  This means sanity checks should
  reflect;

    1. The common cases
    2. The edge cases
    3. Likely mistakes you'll make in your code (e.g., using <= instead of <)

  What these cases mean concretely depends on what your function does.

 ** Hint #1 **
 Use .toString(); to convert a number to a string.  That is,

  (5).toString();
    => "5"
  (100).toString();
    => "100"

 Remember: these are rumble strips, not a driving instructor.
 If any are "false" then something is broken. But just because they all return
 "true" doesn't mean you've nailed it. =]
