/*
  Function name:  longestString(list);
  Inputs:         A list of strings
  Returns:        The longest string in the list
  Prints:         Nothing

  For example, longestString(["a", "zzzz", "c"]) should return "zzzz" since
  the other strings are 1 character long and "zzzz" is 4 characters long.

  To find the length of the string in the variable myString, call myString.length.

  For example,
    var myString = "zzzz";
    console.log(myString.length);
    => 4

/*
  I'd advise putting some sanity checks here.
  How else will you confirm that your code does what you think it does?
