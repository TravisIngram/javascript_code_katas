  ** Note #1 **
  Since these specific tools aren't available in JavaScript, this particular
  exercise doesn't directly translate.

  I will see if there is a way to do similar things and up date this accordingly.

  ** Note #2 **
  You'll need to install the nokogiri package if you haven't, yet.  Run this
  from the command line to install it:

    npm install nokogiri

  Here are some tutorials on how to use Nokogiri to do this.

function findLinks(url) {
  // This should return an array of all links at the given URL.
}

  console.log(findLinks("http://www.cnn.com/").each do |url|
    puts url
