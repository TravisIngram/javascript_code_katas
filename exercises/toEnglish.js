/*
  Function name:  toEnglish(num);
  Inputs:         A number.
  Returns:        A String representing the number in English.
  Prints:         Nothing

  Write a method that takes a positive integer as input and returns the input
  in "plain English."

  For example,

    toEnglish(1);     == "one"
    toEnglish(12);    == "twelve"
    toEnglish(123);   == "one hundred twenty three"
    toEnglish(1234);  == "one thousand two hundred thirty four"
    toEnglish(12345); == "twelve thousand three hundred forty five"

  You can decide the largest power of 10 you wish to support, but you should
  support at least up to the billions.

  ** Hint #1 **
  Write down a bunch of examples and look for patterns.
  What words make up "special cases?" There are likely fewer than you think
  if you can find ways to combine simpler patterns into larger ones.

function toEnglish(num) {
  // You have to fill in the details here!  =]
}

/*
  Write some of your own "sanity checks" here.  Each check should look like:

    console.log(toEnglish(); == ...expected return value...);

  A good sanity check is like a canary in a coal mine: when it fails we know
  something is very wrong in our code.  This means sanity checks should
  reflect;

    1. The common cases
    2. The edge cases
    3. Likely mistakes you'll make in your code (e.g., using <= instead of <)

  What these cases mean concretely depends on what your function does.

  Hey, there are a bunch of lovely test cases above.  Start with those. =]
